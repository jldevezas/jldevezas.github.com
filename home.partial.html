			<h2>Commitment </h2>
			<p>I put the project and the people before anything else. I only take on projects
			that I believe in and look for people I like to work with. Once I commit to a project, I
			often don't stop until it's ready. I encourage a similar commitment from the people I
			work with.</p>

			<h2>Expertise</h2>
			<p>For years, I've worked as a researcher in a mixed environment where academy and
			corporate meet to solve real-world problems. This duality gave me strengths from both
			worlds, which are often valuable in a competitive and innovative market.</p>

			<h2>Knowledge</h2>
			<p>Given my academic background, I love to teach and guide people, and I love to work as
			a team. I've recently moved out of research to pursue this goal of sharing knowledge and
			creating and innovating as a team, since I believe I can do the most good here.</p>
