      <h2>Commitment</h2>
      <p>I put the project and the people before anything else. I only take on projects that I believe in and look for people I like to work with. Once I commit to a project, I often don't stop until it's ready. I encourage a similar commitment from the people I work with.</p>

      <h2>Expertise</h2>
      <p>For years, I've worked as a researcher in a mixed environment where academy and corporate meet to solve real-world problems. This duality gave me strengths from both worlds, which are often valuable in a competitive and innovative market.</p>
