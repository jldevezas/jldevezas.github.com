- A creative, depressive, classical liberal `PhD in Computer Science` from Portugal.
- Specialist in `information retrieval` and `network science`.
- Also loves and can do `machine learning`, as well as `data analysis` and `visualization`.
- Mainly codes in `Python`; also mastered `R`, but is leaving it behind nowadays.
- Believer in diversity and equality, but not the "offended" or "triggered".
- `No-bullshit`, people-take-precedence policy, and openness to questions, are two of his main traits.
- Gets bored easily, works best when focused on a single, challenging goal.
- Disbeliever in multitasking.
- Doesn't care about benefits, only value (fiat or `crypto`).
- `Anti` compartmentalization, emotional intelligence, or `social convention`.
- Believes an individual should be `free to be` himself/herself regardless of context.
- `Engineer`, programmer, sysadmin (my memory sucks, so I search the web a lot, but I get it done).
- Did I mention the `no-bullshit` policy?
